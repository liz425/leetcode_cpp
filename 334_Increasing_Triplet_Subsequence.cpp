    //Assume that [AA, BB, CC] is the first triplet we encountered, then AA must be the smallest item
    //seen so far(within all the nums before AA).
    //Prove: If there exist a number DD before AA and DD < AA, then [DD, BB, CC] will form a triplet,
    //violating our assumption.
    //Then according to our algo, it will assign AA to c1.
    //----------------------------------------------------
    //Deduction2: nums between AA and BB must be larger than BB.
    //Prove: first, all of those nums are larger than AA, otherwise AA will be assign to a new number.
    //If one of those nums EE is small than BB, then [AA, EE, BB] will form a triplet.
    //Accord to our algo, BB will be assigned to c2.
    //-------------------
    //At last, as long as there is a CC larger than BB, our algo will return true.
